/* X0X drum part: the 9W9 TR-909 engine (Charles Vestal, GPL-3.0; itself grown out
 * of ER-99 by Matthew Cieplak, GPL-3.0), ported to the FM-1.
 *
 * Circuit-modelled BD, SD, LT/MT/HT, RS, CP; sampled CH/OH (one buffer, choking
 * each other), CR, RD -- the same models, pot tables and defaults as 9W9. The
 * send reverb / delay and the master stage live in fxbus.{h,c}.
 *
 * Mono, 44.1 kHz, float, no libm, no allocation. Idle voices cost nothing:
 * every voice has 9W9's mute countdown, and the block loop runs a voice only for
 * the samples it is still sounding.
 *
 * Threading: drum909_trigger / drum909_set are called between render blocks
 * (the same thread, or with the audio ISR held off); none of them loops over
 * more than a few dozen operations. */
