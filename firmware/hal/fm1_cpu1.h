/* The AC79's second core (docs/plans/2026-10-04-dual-core-and-clock.md), with what Melodee's
 * dual-core audio (github.com/keremimo/melodee, GPL-3.0) found on the device.
 *
 * Start (the AC79 SDK's EnableOtherCpu): core 1's interrupt bank off (0x1EEF300..), its entry
 * address into the word at 0x01C7FFF8, bit 3 of 0x10008 held while it starts, C1_CON (0x1EEE004)
 * bit 3 set (enabled) and bit 1 cleared (out of hold). It boots through the chip's ROM, which the
 * PC limits refuse, so they are open until it has reported in from fm1_c1_main. Hold is bit 1
 * set, then bit 3 cleared.
 *
 * Work: one job at a time, a function and an argument; core 0 hands it over (c1_job) and waits
 * for it (c1_done), single writer each way, csync around each (the cores share the caches).
 *
 * Flash: the waiting loop is in RAM (.c1_text), so an idle core 1 never fetches from the flash;
 * it works only for the audio interrupt, which waits for it before it returns, and core 0 turns
 * the flash off only with interrupts off. So the flash is never off under it. */
